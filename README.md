Graphical Passwords

Graphical passwords use images rather than text when a user logs in. They choose 3 images when they register from the system. When they log in, they are shown many images and have to recognise the three that they originally chose.

Registration process
The user is shown 60 images on three pages and must choose 3 images. They can come from any of the pages and don't have to be one from each page. The 60 images are chosen from a collection of several hundred. The user's choice is noted and 17 other images are also chosen and associated with the user. These are called distractor images.
These 17 images can either:-
    1. be chosen from the original 60 images, and are thus images that the user has seen but rejected, or
    2. be chosen from the rest of the collection and are images that the user has now seen before.

The system should record the time taken to choose each image.

Login process
The user is shown 20 images, the 3 images that they originally picked and the 17 distractor images. They should be arranged in a different order each time the user logs in. The user must choose the correct images, in the correct order, to succeed. The system should record the order that images are chosen and the outcome of the login. It should also record the time taken to select each image.

Experiments
The recorded data can be processed to see the choice of distractor images and whether 1. or 2. has any effect on the success and time of login. The recorded data can also show reasons for failure, such as images selected in the wrong order, and how many images were wrong etc..

User Study
Users try out the system and we can find out the approach they prefer and the implications as a barrier to attacks.
